# CUBA (CAN-UART Bridge Analyzer)
Library that creates a bridge between two microcontroller communication peripherals, CAN and UART. Detects the reception of CAN messages and uses the message information (i.e., message identifier, type identifier, DLC, frame type, direction, and data frame) to write a string of ASCII characters with the analyzed data information, then stores it in memory space and finally uses the DMA to send it through UART to a computer terminal without cycling the CPU during the process.
